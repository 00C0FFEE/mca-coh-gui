GUI-based COH dongle backup tool for Namco System246 / 256.  

# Caution

With a view to preventing the distribution of illegal copy dongles, this application will not work by itself.  
For it to work, 'mca-coh.exe' must exist in the 'res' folder in the same location as the application.  
mca-coh.exe must be obtained from somewhere on your own.

This application was created solely to facilitate backup of the dongle and cannot be used for any other purpose such as selling illegal copies.  
If it is discovered that this application is being used for such purposes, this repository will be immediately frozen and completely deleted.  

## What can you do?

It can rewrite or dump files in the dongle.  
This allows you to back up your Sys2x6 game dongle.  

It is possible to replace one dongle with another game dongle by rewriting the dongle-specific keys.  

This application can only be read by the Sys2x6 COH dongle (COH-H10020).  
PS2 memory card (SCPH-10020) cannot be read.
